# ISLR_gene-expression_clustering_regression

In this project, I conducted a cluster analysis using hierarchical and k-means clustering on the ISLR gene expression dataset, consisting of 40 tissue samples with measurements on 1,000 genes. Additionally, I performed linear regression on the diabetes data to develop a model for predicting disease progression on the basis of one or more of the 10 baseline variables. I split the data into a training and validation set, computed the test error for a multiple linear regression model, a 6-predictor model, and a ridge regression model with cross-validation to identify the optimal tuning parameter. I also generated a plot of the regression coefficients for different values of the tuning parameter and compared the test errors to determine the best model.
